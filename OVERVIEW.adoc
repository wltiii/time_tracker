= Driven Design Principles In Flutter

== Disclaimer
The documentation contained within this project is meant only as a general guideline regarding the structure of an application organized along Domain Driven Design (DDD) principles.
It describes potential examples.
Artifacts contained within the project bearing the same name as used in the documentation should be considered coincidental.

== Overview
A Flutter project using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) should be organized into distinct layers that correspond to different parts of the application domain. For example:

. Presentation
. Application
. Domain
. Infrastructure

Each layer should be highly cohesive and loosely coupled to the other layers.
This allows for better maintainability, testability, and extensibility of the application.
Additionally, the domain layer should be the central focus of the design, with the other layers serving to support and implement the core domain logic.

In this organization, the presentation layer depends on the application layer, the application layer depends on the domain layer, and the domain layer depends on the infrastructure layer.
This allows for clear separation of concerns and better maintainability of the application.

The domain layer should be independent of the user interface and the technical implementation of the application.
This allows the domain logic to be tested, maintained, and reused in other contexts.
Additionally, the domain layer should be the central focus of the design, with the other layers serving to support and implement the core domain logic.

== Building A Time Tracking Application In Flutter

To create a time tracking app in Flutter using Domain Driven Design principles, you would need to follow these steps:

. Identify the core domain of the app, which in this case is time tracking.

. Identify the key entities in the domain, such as tasks, projects, and time entries.

. Define the relationships between these entities and how they interact with each other. For example, a task can be part of a project and a time entry can be associated with a specific task.

. Identify the key activities in the domain, such as creating tasks, recording time, and generating reports.

. Define the rules and business logic that govern these activities, such as how time entries are calculated and how they affect the overall project budget.

. Design the user interface and user experience of the app, keeping in mind the key activities and business logic of the app.

. Implement the app using Flutter, following the principles of domain driven design and ensuring that the app is easy to use and maintain.

Overall, the key to creating a successful time tracking app using domain driven design principles is to clearly identify and understand the core domain, entities, and activities, and to design and implement the app in a way that aligns with these concepts.
This will help to ensure that the app is both functional and user-friendly.

== Domain Layer, Usecases And Domain Services

In domain-driven design (DDD), a use case represents a specific and complete interaction between a user and the system, such as placing an order or transferring money between accounts. It represents a high-level business goal that the user wants to achieve and is typically implemented as a standalone class or module.
A domain service, on the other hand, is a component of the system that performs a specific task or operation within a domain. It is a layer of the application that encapsulates the business logic and operations related to a particular domain. Domain services are typically stateless and are used to perform tasks that are not specific to any particular entity or value object in the domain, such as calculating shipping costs or generating reports.
In general, use cases represent the interactions between the system and its users, while domain services represent the operations and business logic within the domain.

It is common to place use cases and domain services in separate directories within the application's domain layer.
For example, you might have a directory structure that looks something like this:

src/ +
|- domain/ +
|   |- usecases/ +
|   |- services/ +
|- application/ +
|- infrastructure/ +
|- presentation/

In this structure, the usecases directory would contain the use case classes, and the services directory would contain the domain service classes.
It is also common to further organize the use cases and services directories by subdomain or feature.
For example, you might have a payment subdirectory within the usecases and services directories for use cases and services related to payment processing.

src/ +
|- domain/ +
|   |- usecases/ +
|   |   |- payment/ +
|   |- services/ +
|   |   |- payment/ +
|- application/ +
|- infrastructure/ +
|- presentation/

Ultimately, the specific organization of directories and files in an application will depend on the needs and conventions of your specific project.

== Application Layer, Services, Events, Adapters And Policies

The application layer is typically responsible for coordinating the flow of control between the various components of the system.
Some examples of the types of components that might reside in the application layer include:

. Application Services +
These are classes that expose a high-level interface to the rest of the application, allowing it to perform business actions or operations.
They might invoke use cases from the domain layer or delegate tasks to domain entities or value objects.

. Application Events +
These are classes or components that represent events that occur within the application, such as the creation of a new entity or the completion of a business action.
They can be used to trigger actions or notifications within the application or to update other components of the system.

. Application Adapters +
These are components that adapt the application to external systems or interfaces, such as APIs or third-party libraries.
They might convert data formats or handle authentication and authorization.

. Application Policies +
These are classes that implement business rules or constraints that apply across the application.
They might enforce access controls or validate data before it is persisted to the database.

The specific components that you include in the application layer will depend on the needs and requirements of your specific application.
The goal of the application layer is to provide a high-level interface for interacting with the domain layer and other components of the system, and to coordinate the flow of control between these components.
