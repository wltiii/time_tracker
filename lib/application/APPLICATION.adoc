= Driven Design Principles Application Layer

== Explanation

This layer contains the business logic of the application, such as application services and use cases. It is responsible for orchestrating the flow of data between the _presentation_ layer and the _domain_ layer.

The business logic of is implemented via:

. Services for creating, completing, and viewing tasks.

. Use Cases that describe a specific way in which a user might interact with an application or system. This can include things like providing input, accessing a specific feature, or achieving a particular result. In code, a use case might be represented as a function or method that can be called to perform the actions described in the use case.
