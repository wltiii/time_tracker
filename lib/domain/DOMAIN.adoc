= Driven Design Principles Domain Layer

== Explanation

This layer contains the core domain entities and logic, such as value objects, entities, and domain services.

The domain layer is the central part of a Flutter project using Domain-Driven Design (DDD). It contains the core entities and logic of the application, independent of the technical details of the implementation.

In the domain layer, entities are the core objects that represent the state and behavior of the domain. For example, in a to-do list application, the Task entity might represent a single task that a user can create, complete, and view.

Value objects are objects that represent a value in the domain, without having a distinct identity. For example, in a to-do list application, the DueDate value object might represent the date and time when a task is due.

Domain services are classes that implement business logic that is not specific to a particular entity in the domain. For example, in a to-do list application, a domain service might be responsible for calculating the total number of tasks that are overdue.

*The domain layer should be independent of the user interface and the technical implementation of the application.* This allows the domain logic to be tested, maintained, and reused in other contexts.

Additionally, the domain layer should be the central focus of the design, with the other layers serving to support and implement the core domain logic.

== Potential Domain Objects

In a time tracking application, you might find objects such as:

. *Time Entry*
These are the individual units of time that are tracked by the application.
A time entry might include information such as the date and time it was created, the duration of the time period it covers, and any relevant notes or comments.

. *Project*
Represents a specific task or group of tasks that a user is working on.
These are the broader categories or groups that time entries can be associated with.
For example, a project might represent a specific client or project that an individual is working on.
All the time entries for that project would be grouped together.


. *Client*
Represents a person or organization for which the user is doing work.

. *Users*
Represents a person who is using the application to track their time.
A user might have their own profile, including information such as their name and contact details, as well as their own collection of time entries and projects.

. *Task*
Represents a specific piece of work that a user is completing as part of a project.

. *Category*
Provides the capability to group similar time entries or projects together.

. *Reports*
These are the summaries and visualizations that are generated by the time tracking application to help users understand their time usage.
Reports might include information such as the total time spent on a particular project, or a breakdown of time entries by day or week.
It might be represented as settings that could include title, subtitle, as well as defining the period, users, clients, categories, etc. that would be included in a given report.

. *Settings*
These are the configuration options that allow users to customize the behavior of the time tracking application.
Settings might include things like the default duration for time entries, or the format for displaying dates and times.
