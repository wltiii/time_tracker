= Driven Design Principles Domain Layer

== Explanation

This layer contains the core domain entities and logic, such as value objects, entities, and domain services.

The domain layer is the central part of a Flutter project using Domain-Driven Design (DDD). It contains the core entities and logic of the application, independent of the technical details of the implementation.

In the domain layer, entities are the core objects that represent the state and behavior of the domain. For example, in a to-do list application, the Task entity might represent a single task that a user can create, complete, and view.

Value objects are objects that represent a value in the domain, without having a distinct identity. For example, in a to-do list application, the DueDate value object might represent the date and time when a task is due.

Domain services are classes that implement business logic that is not specific to a particular entity in the domain. For example, in a to-do list application, a domain service might be responsible for calculating the total number of tasks that are overdue.

*The domain layer should be independent of the user interface and the technical implementation of the application.* This allows the domain logic to be tested, maintained, and reused in other contexts.

Additionally, the domain layer should be the central focus of the design, with the other layers serving to support and implement the core domain logic.
