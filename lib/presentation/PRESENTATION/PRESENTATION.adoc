= Driven Design Principles Presentation Layer

== Explanation

The presentation layer contains the user interface components of a Flutter project using Domain-Driven Design (DDD). This may include screens, widgets, and other visual elements that the user interacts with, as well as the code that manages routing and navigation within the application.

. Screens are the top-level components that represent a specific view in the application. For example, in a to-do list application, there might be a screen for creating tasks, a screen for viewing tasks, and a screen for viewing task history.

. Widgets are the building blocks of the user interface. They are reusable components that can be composed to create the user interface of the application. For example, in a to-do list application, there might be a widget for displaying a task, a widget for editing a task, and a widget for displaying a list of tasks.
